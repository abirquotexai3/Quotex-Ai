## Getting Started ðŸš€

Follow these steps to clone the repository and start using the app.

### Prerequisites

- An account on [Descope](https://descope.com/).

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/descope-sample-apps/descope-netlify-template
cd descope-netlify-template
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash

npm install netlify-cli -g
npm install @descope/nextjs-sdk
```

### Connect To Netlify

The Netlify initialization script will walk you through how to connect to a new or existing Netlify project.

```bash

```

### Configuration

Before you run the app, make sure to configure the following:

- **Environment Variables**: Set up your environment variables in a `.env.local` file or on the Netlify project dashboard under site configuration -> Environment variables. You'll need to include your Descope project settings:

```
####### Descope ENV Variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID="" // Descope Project ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_DESCOPE_FLOW_ID="" // Descope flow to use on Sign In Page
```

### Running the App

Once you've configured your app, you're ready to run it:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This command starts the Next.js development server, making your app accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
